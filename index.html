    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advice a potential client to follow some of the Web Security best practices, such as sanitization of data, make sure they have a secure authorization and authentication for logins. I would also recoment them of using CI/CD to keep an eye of code production and keep an eye on the security. I would also recomend them to use automatic user timeout to make sure the browser doesnt keep a user on a page with sensitive information for too long.</p>
